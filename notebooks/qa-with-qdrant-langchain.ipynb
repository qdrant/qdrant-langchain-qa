Weâ€™re all in desperate need of scalable yet simply interpretable methods, and similarity-based ones were great candidates but offered poor performance back in the day. KNN doesn't scale well, but ANN does it seamlessly. And if we want to include some additional filtering, [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech) offers a unique custom implementation of HNSW (the best ANN algorithm, according to benchmarks), with additional filters already built-in."
